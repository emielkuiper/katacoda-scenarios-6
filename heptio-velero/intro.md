Velero gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. Velero lets you:

- Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
- Copy cluster resources across cloud providers. NOTE: Cloud volume migrations are not yet supported.
- Replicate your production environment for development and testing environments.

Velero consists of:

- A server that runs on your cluster
- A command-line client that runs locally

For more information, [the documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.1.0/) provides a getting started guide, plus information about building from source, architecture, extending Velero, and more.
