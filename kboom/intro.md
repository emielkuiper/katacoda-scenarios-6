[`kboom`](https://github.com/mhausenblas/kboom) is the Kubernetes equivalent of [`boom`](https://github.com/tarekziade/boom), allowing you to create short-term load for scale testing and long-term load for soak testing.
Supported load out of the box for scale testing are pods and custom resources via CRDs for soak testing is planned.
